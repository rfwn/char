# char - a typescript discord bot template

i had enough of "write the same shit for each project" so i made this
this is not for js/ts newbies and i wont guide you on how do change certain things so good luck cuz you are definitely going to do that

## features

- autoregister and reload commands (and context menus)
- bloated but pretty logger
- error transmitter which sounds cool but all it does it send the errors to a webhook so you dont have to ssh into the goddamn server
- easy event and command handling
- database support (there is a nodb branch if you dont need it) using typeorm so i wont enforce you to use silly mongodb
- honestly i thought this is a lot but when writing this i notice that ive achieved the goal again, write a lot for no shit

## how to \<do that thing\>?

no thanks i had enough
just wrote all this useless shit so it doesnt look that bad
good luck
